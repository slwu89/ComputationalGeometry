# ComputationalGeometry

Provide access from R to the CGAL C++ library of algorithms for computational geometry, especially for spatial analysis.

## Weighted Voronoi Tessellation

Based on input of spatial point patterns in R, produce a Voronoi tesselation with optional weights. See http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Apollonius_graph_2/index.html for details.
